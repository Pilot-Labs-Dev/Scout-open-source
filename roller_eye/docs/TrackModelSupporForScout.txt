1.Introduction:
  To support track model,there are two major concerns:
1.1 Movement:
  For the track model ,it's not able to move in x direction , thus we neet to turn to x direction, move and then turn back to y direction;
1.2 Resistance:
  Due to the track and to wheels, the resistance for move and rotation will increase, in the software we need to make the scout move or turn
at higher speed than wheel models, therefore the minimum roll speed will be increasd to 2.0 ( origin is 1.0)
2.Implementation:
2.1 Model selection
  To be compatible with origin wheel medel, a setting entry was add to select track model , the default behaviour is wheel model, when the track 
setting was selected when the App connect to the scout, track model will be activated.
2.2 Pathing and patrol
  This part is generally the same as wheel model, besides you can move directly in x direction, and the minimum roll speed is set to 2.0
2.3 BackingUp
    When backingup started, home detection is the same, after home detected, behaviour will be different
2.3.1 align to charge pile
   The goal of align is to move the scout to the straight ahead of home, at proper distance, to get this, the track will move in several steps,
in each step,the socut may turn twice and move twice
2.3.2 connect to  charge pile
   Due to the resisance of the track ,when do backup charge, the socut will more like to climb the pile, to fix to the charge point ,the scout may  
nedd to move forware,backward,and back force for several times.
